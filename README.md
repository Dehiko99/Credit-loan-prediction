# Credit-loan-prediction
The goal of this project is to accurately classify credit loans and identificate important variables and their impact on the target variable. The targetvariable is binary: with 1 it identifies good clients, and with 0 bad clients. In order to do that, I used several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, shrinkage methods, Random Forest, XGBoost). During the logistic regression I gave particular attention to the threshold to minimize the False Negative Rate. In the end I applied the loss given default (it refers to the amount of loss that a lender or investor incurs when a borrower defaults on a loan or financial obligation).
